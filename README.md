In simple words, personal finance entails all the financial decisions and activities that a Finance app makes your life easier by helping you to manage your finances<br> efficiently. A personal finance app will not only help you with budgeting and accounting but also give you helpful insights about money management.<br>


Personal finance applications will ask users to add their expenses and based on their expenses wallet balance will be updated which will be visible to the user.  Also,<br> users can get an analysis of their expenditure in graphical forms. They have an option to set a limit for the amount to be used for that particular month if the <br>limit is exceeded the user will be notified with an email alert.
